Airbnb,"Staff Machine Learning Engineer, Trust",Senior Machine Learning Engineer,United States,https://careers.airbnb.com/positions/7103016?gh_jid=7103016,"Airbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way. The Community You Will Join: The Identity Defense team plays a critical role in safeguarding Airbnb’s platform by ensuring that every user is who they say they are. We are responsible for preventing identity misuse, detecting fraudulent and duplicate accounts, and enforcing policies against underage use. We operate at the intersection of backend engineering, machine learning, and computer vision to deliver defenses at scale—while minimizing friction for trusted users. The Difference You Will Make: Solving Identity Defense Problems Including: Identity Misuse Detection - Fraudsters increasingly use fake, stolen, or AI-generated identities to gain access to the platform. Traditional verification signals are no longer enough in the face of sophisticated tampering techniques like deepfakes and synthetic imagery. Our team builds advanced detection systems that combine machine learning, computer vision, and biometric signals to identify and stop bad actors in real time. We continuously evolve our models and systems to keep pace with rapidly advancing AI-driven attack vectors, ensuring Airbnb stays one step ahead. Duplicate Account Prevention - Airbnb’s integrity depends on enforcing the principle of one account per person. We’re tackling this using identity linking methods that combine graph-based analysis, embeddings, and device IDs. The scale, complexity, and ambiguity of identity data make this one of the most technically demanding problems at Airbnb. Underage User Enforcement - Airbnb prohibits users under the age of 18 from accessing the platform, but verifying age accurately—especially across global markets and varying document types—is a nuanced challenge. Fraudsters exploit OCR weaknesses or use borrowed identities to circumvent our policy. We are investing in government ID parsing improvements, tampering detection, and more robust age inference methods to ensure compliance while minimizing false positives.

Who weâre looking for:
Right now, weâre looking for a 
Data Engineer
 with expertise in data pipelines, workflow orchestration, and data integration.
 Our current approach to data ingestion relies on an in-house application that defines lightweight workflows in code and executes them with queues. Weâre now expanding this process by adopting 
Prefect
 as an orchestration tool, enabling us to manage pipelines for structured and unstructured data from diverse sources, including web crawls and scrapers.
In this role, youâll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. Responsibilities will include:
Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift
Extracting and enriching additional data elements from diverse sources
Reprocessing and validating large datasets in batch workflows
Designing and integrating new data sources into existing pipelines
Aligning and integrating extracted data with the core application data model to ensure consistency and usability
Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed
The person weâre looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. Theyâre flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work âsmartâ, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently, they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top-level/strategic conversations.
We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well-rounded sense of design & quality â so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!
ð¸ Compensation
Our pay scale ranges from 
$85 p/hr
 to 
$130 p/hr
 pending seniority (& team leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full-time weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for going over and above â like training & coaching others, winning new business, speaking at conferences, etc.
We prefer long-standing relationships with highly accountable and communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer-term engagements. A Data Engineer working 40 â 45 full-time weeks may take home 
$150k â $200k USD.

Python

ð¤ 
How we interview:
Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there weâll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.
â Itâs also a great way to see what itâs like to work with us and help support folks who may not have the âright titleâ but have the experience and technical know-how for the role.
ð©âð­ 
How we work:
We believe that thereâs a better balance between the poles of freelancing & full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:
Transparency & Ownership:
Â We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. Weâre proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
150% Carbon Negative:
 Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. 
We were certified climate neutral earlier this year
.
Strong Morals:
Â Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
Async & Decentralized:
 We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
Remote Friendly:
Â Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
Ideas & Products:
Â In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

Those 150 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency.
