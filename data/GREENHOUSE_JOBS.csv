&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop and implement a comprehensive security operations strategy and roadmap&lt;/strong&gt; aligned with Squarespace&#39;s overall our goals and risk appetite. This goes beyond just &quot;implementing new security programs&quot; to encompass a holistic vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversee the Security Operations Center (SOC) activities&lt;/strong&gt;, including threat detection, monitoring, analysis, and proactive hunting, ensuring 24/7/365 coverage as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain a robust incident response program&lt;/strong&gt;, including defining incident playbooks, leading major incident investigations, and conducting post-incident reviews to drive continuous improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage and enhance the vulnerability management program&lt;/strong&gt;, from identification and assessment to prioritization and remediation tracking across all Squarespace assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead efforts in security architecture review and design consultation&lt;/strong&gt; for new products, features, and infrastructure changes to ensure security is built-in from the outset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify, evaluate, and implement new security technologies and tools&lt;/strong&gt; to enhance detection, prevention, and response capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive continuous improvement of security operations processes&lt;/strong&gt; through automation, tooling, and best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay abreast of emerging security threats, vulnerabilities, and industry trends&lt;/strong&gt; and proactively advise leadership on necessary adjustments to strengthen Squarespace&#39;s security posture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute to the development and enforcement of security policies, standards, and guidelines&lt;/strong&gt; across the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leadership &amp;amp; Collaboration:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build, mentor, and lead a high-performing team of security professionals&lt;/strong&gt;, fostering a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and accountability. This explicitly states the &quot;building&quot; aspect of a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act as a key liaison and trusted advisor to internal stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., Engineering, Product, Legal, Compliance, IT) on security-related matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage relationships with external security vendors and partners&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring effective service delivery and technology adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversee security compliance activities&lt;/strong&gt; related to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) and frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001), ensuring Squarespace&#39;s adherence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote a culture of security by design&lt;/strong&gt; by working closely with development teams to integrate security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with partner teams to implement new security programs and refine existing ones, with an emphasis on driving the team&#39;s velocity while also maintaining high customer and employee engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
