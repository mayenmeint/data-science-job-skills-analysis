Who weâre looking for:
Right now, weâre looking for a 
Data Engineer
 with expertise in data pipelines, workflow orchestration, and data integration.
 Our current approach to data ingestion relies on an in-house application that defines lightweight workflows in code and executes them with queues. Weâre now expanding this process by adopting 
Prefect
 as an orchestration tool, enabling us to manage pipelines for structured and unstructured data from diverse sources, including web crawls and scrapers.
In this role, youâll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. Responsibilities will include:
Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift

Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed
The person weâre looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. Theyâre flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work âsmartâ, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently, they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top-level/strategic conversations.
We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well-rounded sense of design & quality â so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!
ð¸ Compensation
Our pay scale ranges from 
$85 p/hr
 to 
$130 p/hr
 pending seniority (& team leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full-time weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for going over and above â like training & coaching others, winning new business, speaking at conferences, etc.
We prefer long-standing relationships with highly accountable and communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer-term engagements. A Data Engineer working 40 â 45 full-time weeks may take home 
$150k â $200k USD.

How we interview:
Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there weâll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.
â Itâs also a great way to see what itâs like to work with us and help support folks who may not have the âright titleâ but have the experience and technical know-how for the role.
ð©âð­ 
How we work:
We believe that thereâs a better balance between the poles of freelancing & full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:
Transparency & Ownership:
Â We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. Weâre proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
150% Carbon Negative:
 Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same. 
We were certified climate neutral earlier this year
.
Strong Morals:
Â Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
Async & Decentralized:
 We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
Remote Friendly:
Â Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
Ideas & Products:
Â In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?

JLS Trading Co,Social Media Manager & Shitposter @ Fun Ecom Co,Remote,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-social-media-manager-shitposter-fun-ecom-co-jls-trading-co-1104790,"- Do you have trouble communicating through anything but memes?
- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social media addiction?
- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?
If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that donât put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is!
We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.
--Is this a real job ad?--
Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And itâs not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - weâre big time, people.
Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - weâre a pretty big deal):
http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/
And check out our reviews on 
Google
, 
Glassdoor
, or 
Indeed
 to see that itâs not just the founderâs mother who says weâre cool.
--What do you guys do?--
We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):Â 
- Bad Parking Cards (
https://amz.run/5Eya
)
- Beverage Barricades (
https://amz.run/6kip
)
- Child Chucker (
https://amz.run/9EUz
)
Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (weâre really, really good at PPC)
And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.
We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and itâs our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.
--What is your company like?--
1. You Can Be Yourself. You donât have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.
2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesnât matter what your credentials are â it matters what you get done.
3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we donât care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, weâre happy campers.
4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If youâre routinely working more than 45ish hours, youâre gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.
5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.
6. No Micro-Management. Once youâre trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably arenât the place for you.
7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]
8. Supportive Environment. We donât operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful â internal politics are at a minimum here.
9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.
10. Weâll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. Youâll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.
11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.
12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. Weâve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!
13. Self-Funded So We Can Do Whatâs Right for Us. We donât have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.
--What are your companyâs values?--
See here: 
http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/
Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - itâs not just normal corporate BS. We promise youâll learn a lot about us.
--OK, so Iâve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--
No.
--Wait... What?--
OK fiiine.
Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else you can to create raving fans of our brands (
Witty Yeti
 will be your primary project at the start).
We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are doing now isnât enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge and sense of humor to help get there.
Youâre gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow our social media - weâre not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation (letâs hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).
Youâre basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The Peopleâ¢. Maybe itâs updating our page, maybe itâs making some thumbnails (we can teach you), maybe itâs responding with the perfect GIF, maybe itâs crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing youâve ever heard.
Weâll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone. Weâll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.
Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.
--Do I need experience?--
We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).
Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.
Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.
Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.
I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. Iâm literally shaking right now.
Also, no you don't need any experience.
We want special people, and donât give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.
The Big Bang requirement still stands though.
--Do I need a college degree?--
You just need to be awesome.
--Are there any geographic restrictions?--
As long as you are in a country that doesnât have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isnât known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, soâ¦
--What are your social media accounts?--
This will give you an idea of what weâre currently doing:
https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com
https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/
--I know a ton about social media but havenât ârunâ it before--
As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what weâre doing), then youâll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do great.
--This sounds pretty good, though Iâm still skeptical that this isnât a pyramid scheme.--
You sound just like the tax authorities!
--That doesnât resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--
Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.
There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.
Once youâre in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely donât want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you âyesâ or ânoâ, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).
Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

As AI capabilities rapidly advance, we face a fundamental knowledge gap: we don't yet fully understand the complex dynamics that determine whether AI systems, or even individual capabilities of them, predominantly threaten or protect society. In this role, you'll lead research to decode these offense-defense dynamics, examining how specific attributes of AI technologies influence their propensity to either enhance societal safety or amplify risks. You'll apply interdisciplinary methods to develop quantitative and qualitative frameworks that analyze how AI capabilities proliferate through society as either protective or harmful applications, producing actionable insights for developers, evaluators, standards bodies, and policymakers to anticipate and mitigate risks. This position offers a unique opportunity to shape how society evaluates and governs increasingly powerful AI systems, with direct impact on global efforts to maximize AI's benefits while minimizing risks. This role is 100% remote but requires occasional travel.
About CARMA
The Center for AI Risk Management & Alignment (CARMA) works to help society navigate the complex and potentially catastrophic risks arising from increasingly powerful AI systems. Our mission is specifically to lower the risks to humanity and the biosphere from transformative AI.
We focus on grounding AI risk management in rigorous analysis, developing policy frameworks that squarely address AGI, advancing technical safety approaches, and fostering global perspectives on durable safety. Through these complementary approaches, CARMA aims to provide critical support to society for managing the outsized risks from advanced AI before they materialize.
CARMA is a fiscally-sponsored project of Social & Environmental Entrepreneurs, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public benefit corporation.

â¢ Develop quantitative system dynamics models capturing the interrelationships between technological, social, and institutional factors that influence AI risk landscapes
â¢ Design detailed analytical models and simulations to identify critical leverage points where policy interventions could shift offense-defense balances toward safer outcomes
â¢ Expand and operationalize our current offense/defense dynamics taxonomy and nascent framework, developing metrics and models to predict whether specific AI system features favor offensive or defensive applications
â¢ Build empirically-informed analytical frameworks using documented cases of AI misuse and beneficial deployed uses to validate theoretical models
â¢ Research how specific technical characteristics (capabilities breadth/depth, accessibility, adaptability, etc.) interact with sociotechnical contexts to determine offense-defense balances
â¢ Build public understanding of offense-defense dynamics through blog posts, articles, conference talks, and media engagement
â¢ Create tools and methodologies to assess new AI models upon release for their likely offense-defense implications
â¢ Draft evidence-based guidance for AI governance that accounts for complex interdependencies between technological capabilities and deployment contexts
â¢ Translate research findings into actionable guidance for key stakeholders including policymakers, AI developers, security professionals, and standards organizations
Requirements
â¢ A M.Sc. or higher in either Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Criminology, Security Studies, AI Policy, Risk Management, or a related field
â¢ Demonstrated experience with complex systems modeling, risk assessment methodologies, or security analysis
â¢ Strong understanding of dual-use technologies and the factors that influence whether capabilities favor offensive or defensive applications
â¢ Deep understanding of modern AI systems, including large language models, multimodal models, and autonomous agents, with ability to analyze their technical architectures and capability profiles
â¢ Experience in any of the following: Security mindset, Security studies research, Cybersecurity, Safety engineering, AI governance, Operational risk management, Systems dynamics modeling, Network theory, Complexity science, Adversarial analysis, or Technical standards development
â¢ Ability to develop both qualitative frameworks and quantitative models that capture sociotechnical interactions, and comfort creating semi-quantitative semi-empirical models also grounded in logic

Bloom,Director of Finance Poppy &amp; Peonies,Remote,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/remote-director-of-finance-poppy-amp-peonies-bloom-1093882,"Bloom is a full-service workplace design consultancy, proudly supporting Poppy & Peonies in their search for a Director of Finance to join their dynamic team. As Talent Advisors, we serve as the bridge between our Bloom Partner and you throughout the recruitment process. At Bloom, we donât rely on automated tools to sift through applicationsâevery resume is carefully reviewed by a real person to ensure a fair and consistent interview process. If selected, youâll join Poppy & Peonies directly as a valued member of their team. Weâre excited to consider your application! Please note that applications will be accepted throughout the holiday season. Thank you for your patience and interest in this opportunity!
Hi, Iâm Natalie Dusome, Founder and CEO of Poppy & Peonies, a fun and energetic brand that believes styles and function should co-exist. Weâre passionate about creating practical pieces that help make life a little easier and lighten the load, literally. 
Building Poppy & Peonies has been a wild adventure. The journey began when my daughter Poppy was born and my accessories no longer worked with my new life as a mom, I needed bags with pockets and organization that looked cool and had functionality.  I couldnât find it, so I decided to create it, and in 2015 Poppy & Peonies was born. 
Weâve come a long way in five years â from filling orders in my basement to appearing on Dragonsâ Den, and now, expanding into new product categories and collaborating with some exciting influencers and brands. Iâd be lying if I said itâs been nothing but smooth sailing, but thanks to our incredible community, weâve never felt more loved and supported! 
We believe in our responsibility to care for our environment and we are passionate about preserving the health and welfare of our planet, and the animals that live on it. All of our bags are made from high-quality vegan leather, and our entire product line is vegan, cruelty-free, and PETA-approved. We ship our products plastic-free and we use a combination of recycled, compostable, and biodegradable materials to mitigate shipping waste, and we are constantly looking for new ways to make our products and supply chain more sustainable to reduce our carbon footprint.
About the Role
As our Director of Finance, youâll be the financial architect behind our next stage of growthâbuilding the models, insights, and systems that help us scale smartly. From forecasting and cash flow management to driving profitability and ROI across channels, youâll ensure our business moves quickly while staying financially sound. As a trusted partner to the leadership team, youâll bring clarity, discipline, and vision to every decision, enabling us to serve our customers, expand into new markets, and maximize long-term impact.

About Snowplow:
Snowplow is the global leader in customer data infrastructure for AI, enabling every organization to transform raw behavioral data into governed, high-fidelity fuel for AI-powered applicationsâincluding advanced analytics, real-time personalization engines, and AI agents.
Digital-first companies like Strava, HelloFresh, Auto Trader, Burberry, and DPG Media use Snowplow to collect and process event-level data in real time, delivering it securely to their warehouse, lake, or stream, and integrate deep customer context into their applications.
Thousands of companies rely on Snowplow to uncover customer insights, predict customer behaviors, hyper-personalize customer experiences, and detect fraud in real time.
The Opportunity:
We are looking for a Senior full-stack engineer with experience in Scala and React to join our Data Products team at Snowplow. The Data Products team enables customers to rapidly create, govern, and iterate on high-quality behavioral data products that fuel AI-powered applications. We transform the complex process of data creation from weeks to days through intuitive design tools, automated code generation, and comprehensive governance capabilities.
We believe in supporting engineers to have autonomy and responsibility to make decisions, taking ownership of the product from technical design to code to customer. The ideal fit will be an engineer who loves to learn and take on new challenges, and can solve a variety of problems to ensure the success of the overall service, in partnership with our product and customer-facing teams.
If you are growth-oriented, passionate about technology, and excited about building exceptional UIs and complex business services, we want to hear from you!
What youâll be doing:
â 
Working on our Typelevel Scala backend services and our React single-page application.
â Embracing AI coding assistants to delegate the boring, repetitive tasks while focusing on the creative, important work. We believe in AI as an enabler of velocity improvements, while being cognizant of the constraints; and deploy its strengths intentionally.
â Building robust QA, unit and integration tests.
â Writing top documentation about the features you help deliver.
â Taking turns to investigate our customersâ escalated tickets and respond (we donât do on-call rotations, not yet at least).
â Collaborating in Scrum ceremonies and engage with cross-functional teams for requirements.
â Managing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and reliability.
â Monitoring system health with observability tools and address issues proactively.
â Engaging with stakeholders for alignment on project goals and updates.
â Researching new technologies to improve the Snowplow ecosystem.
Weâd love to hear from you if:
â You have professional experience building 1) RESTful APIs with Typelevel Scala, and 2) engaging user experiences for the Web with Typescript and React.
â You understand API and browser performance, as well as web accessibility standards. 
â You have an array of tools under your belt to support making a web application faster and more accessible.
â You place maximum emphasis on security. Data security and integrity are fundamental to what we do, so youâll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them.
â Nice to have, not necessary: Golang and Python experience would come very handy, for a few repositories outside of the critical path.
What We Offer You in Return:
ð° A competitive package, including share options
ð§ Flexible working
ð A generous holiday allowance no matter where you are in the world
ð» MacBook and home office equipment allowance
ðª Enhanced maternity, paternity, shared parental and adoption leave

Weâre looking to collaborate with freelance character concept artists excited by the challenge of designing striking, emotionally resonant characters for Arkheron, our original dark fantasy IP. While we often refer to them as âskins,â these are complete character designs and original creations shaped by compelling visual ideas and storytelling. Our art direction blends stylization with grounded believability, aiming for designs that feel both imaginative and tangible. If your work leans toward the elegant, edgy, and evocative, rather than overly exaggerated or whimsical, youâll likely feel right at home here.
This is an ongoing freelance opportunity. Some projects may move quickly, while others may be scoped further in advance. If youâre available and inspired, weâd love to collaborate.
While this role is fully remote, artists based in Southern California may have the option to connect in person with our team if thatâs something they find creatively valuable.
Please note: This is a contract-based position (freelance or fixed term up to 12 months), and we are unfortunately unable to support visa sponsorship or relocation for this role.

What You'll Do:
Design character skins that are equal parts bold, clear, and evocative, from quick sketches to polished, production-ready concepts.
Explore costume variations, materials, and visual motifs that expand the soul of our world.
Collaborate with art leadership and 3D artists to bring characters to life visually and functionally.
Build reference boards, mood explorations, and idea sketches that unlock new creative directions.
We're Looking For:
A portfolio that shows your range and personality in character design, especially around costume, materials, and shape language.
Solid fundamentals in drawing, anatomy, and design, with a deep curiosity for fashion and visual culture across time and genre.
Experience working in games, film, or entertainment. Bonus points if youâve worked on stylized or skin-based cosmetics.
Great communication, responsiveness, and an enthusiasm for collaborating across disciplines.
Why Create with Bonfire:
Weâre a tight-knit, values-driven team building something original and ambitious together.
Our visual identity leans into the haunting and the beautiful, striking the balance between style and soul.
We make space for authorship, experimentation, and play, and welcome diverse perspectives into every part of our creative process.
This is a great opportunity to leave your mark on an original IP and help shape the look and feel of characters players will remember.
\n
This is a freelance, contract-based position. The pay range for this role is $40-$90 USD per hour, which represents the range we reasonably expect to pay for this position in good faith. Final rates within this range will be based on project scope, length, and the artistâs experience.
