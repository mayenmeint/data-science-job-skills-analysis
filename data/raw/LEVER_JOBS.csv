We launched our first product to market in 2015, partnered with the NIH in 2018, ramped up test-to-treat Covid-19 programs in 2020, and then in 2023 we partnered with the American Cancer Society to launch one of the first dedicated, end-to-end cancer prevention and screening programs. This year, Color expanded the offering into a full-service program we call the Virtual Cancer Clinic that combines early detection and comprehensive cancer management before, during, and after a diagnosis.

About the Role
We’re looking for an Senior Executive Business Partner reporting to Chief of Staff to the CRO and supporting our VP, Global Customer Success and VP, Services & Support, who partner to lead Attentive’s entire post-sale Customer Experience function. This is a hybrid role that combines high-level executive support with operational and program management responsibilities—ideal for someone who thrives in both strategic and tactical work.

You’ll manage core executive support functions like calendar, travel, and expenses, while also owning and driving cross-functional initiatives that span Customer Success, Services, Support, and other go-to-market teams. From building business metrics readouts and creating strategic program frameworks to coordinating the launch of key initiatives, you’ll help turn vision into execution.

This is a unique opportunity to gain visibility into the inner workings of a high-growth SaaS company, work directly with senior leadership, and make an immediate impact on our most important customer-facing priorities.

About Wealthfront Engineering
Wealthfront’s culture centers around continuous learning, innovation, and quality-driven software development. With high quality software as our ultimate engineering objective, our key tactic is automation: 

	• Wealthfront software automates the financial services we provide to our clients, and within these services we automate the collection of data that we learn from on our way to making our services even better.

	• Wealthfront engineers function as builder/operators, with dual responsibility for building the system and operating it in production. Any toil that this brings about is automated away by engineers. This investment in automation is expected, and the prioritization of it is always built into our planning and execution.

	• Wealthfront engineers automate our development processes. For example, Wealthfront engineers automate all of our testing. Manual testing is not part of the software development lifecycle at Wealthfront.

	• Wealthfront engineers automate observability in case of failure. If something is up, our systems inform engineers appropriately. If our systems are quiet, they are healthy.

Design at Wealthfront
Unlike many companies where design teams are trained to make incremental changes and work through a chain of hierarchy to advocate for bold new ideas, the design team at Wealthfront is expected to be innovative, creative and strategic, because design and content are critical to realizing our vision.

We’re empathetic people advocates. We're interested in what our clients need to know, and what they don't. We organize and present content in the most straightforward, useful, and inclusive way. And we’re not just wordsmiths (although we are good at that, too). We partner strategically with our product management and product design counterparts to shape client experiences.

Content designers are expected to define problems, new opportunities and solutions that are deeply rooted in human psychology and behavior as well as a sound understanding of our technology and business, all in very tight collaboration with engineers, product managers, researchers, legal, and data scientists. In an environment where we’re making big bets, and innovation is encouraged, we embrace failure and care much more about the magnitude of success versus percentage of times we are successful. And unlike many organizations, content design and product design are equal partners to engineering and product and each plays an important role in the executive staff that collectively make all critical strategic decisions. 

We’re a remote friendly team and open to candidates in the US.

1. Spin up pilots on a diverse range of premium marketplace content categories (3D) through a mix of in-house production, external vendors and community creators.

2. ROI analysis of different premium content categories and sources of content to clearly identify profitable vs unprofitable investments - to re-deploy budget and/or unlock additional budget.

3. Support prioritization and focus for in-house production to achieve maximum “wow factor” and business impact.

About the Role:

Support Group Facilitators empower and support the Plume community team to effectively provide Plume members with the support they need in navigating their gender journey and achieving improved health and wellness outcomes. This contracted role is overseen by the Community Support Manager. 

As a facilitator, you will facilitate groups of Plume members, cultivating spaces for trans, nonbinary, and non-cis people to share their questions, experiences, and wisdom with one another on various topics; shared experiences, identities, interests, and more. Most groups are held once per week on a specific day and time and are hosted virtually.

This role is contracted and part-time (average 5-8 hours per week, up to 15 hours), with time split between facilitation, preparation, follow-up, and at times, training and consultation. 

Some essential strengths of a Plume Support Group Facilitator should be building trusting relationships, communication, an ability to deal with sensitive and potentially divisive topics in a sensitive and inclusive manner, a deeply personal commitment to providing support to their peers, and an excitement for working in a constantly growing and evolving startup environment.
